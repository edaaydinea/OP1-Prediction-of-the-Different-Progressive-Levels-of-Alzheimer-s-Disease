## A.Business Understanding - Project Objective

- This is an optional model development project on a real dataset related to predicting the different progressive levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The students are expected to use tensorflow library for modeling process and will be asked to submit predicted labels for a test dataset by which their score will be evaulated objectively. 
- This project is included in the *UpSchool - Google Developers Machine Learning - Deep Learning Program*. 
- In this project, you are supposed to provide a data science model to determine the level of Alzheimer disease. The levels are the ordinal categories from lower to higher respectively: 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 (that are the progressive levels of Alzheimer's disease)
- You are expected to use the following features:

Subjects who report no first-degree family members with dementia at all visits where Form A3 is submitted will have naccfam = 0.<br>UDS Form A3 version 3.0 or subsequent versions, submitted at all available visits: If at least one parent, sibling, or child is reported to have both a primary neurological problem/psychiatric condition of cognitive impairment/behavior change (coded as 1) and one of the primary diagnosis codes listed below at any visit, then naccfam = 1. Subjects who report all first-degree family members as having a family history absent of cognitive impairment/psychiatric condition (primary neurological problem/psychiatric condition coded as 2–8) or a primary neurological problem/psychiatric condition is reported (coded as 1), but a code other than those listed below is reported, will have naccfam = 0.<br>For subjects with Form A3 data from multiple form versions, all available data will be included in the calculation of naccfam. For example, if a family history of cognitive impairment is indicated on Form A3 using v3.0 but not on a previous version using v1–2, the subject will still have naccfam = 1.<br>Those with a submitted Form A3 (any version) who are missing data on all first-degree family members are coded as Unknown (naccfam = 9). If some first-degree family members are coded as No and some are coded as Unknown, then they are all coded as Unknown (naccfam = 9).<br>In general, a known history of cognitive impairment reported at any visit supersedes all visits with missing codes. Likewise, an indication of cognitive impairment at any visit supersedes all other visits where a history of cognitive impairment is indicated as not present. In all other conditions where reporting varies, data from the most recent visit are used to calculate naccfam.<br>If Form A3 was never submitted for any version of the UDS, naccfam will take a value of -4. Note that although this variable is listed for all visits, it does not change across visits; it is cross-sectional. |

NACC has created a new derived variable for Total GDS score so that subjects who were given the GDS in the earlier versions of UDS v1 will have a total GDS score if they skipped three or fewer items on the questionnaire. If the subject was missing more than three of the 15 items on the GDS for any UDS version, naccgds = 88. The UDS Coding Guidebook for Form B6 provides the algorithm for calculating the GDS score when three or fewer items are missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## C.Data Analysis

- No data dropping process was performed.
- Quantile values were determined as 0.25 and 0.75, and the values above these values were perceived as outlier and the upper and lower values were equalized to Threshold values.
- There was no missing data.

- In both male and female patients, it was observed that anxiety, depression, irritability and apathy values affect moderate impairment.
- Chi-Square test was performed for nominal variables.At the end of this, the P-Value value of more than 0.5 ['naccfam', 'maristat_4', 'maristat_6'] was decided not to use the model.
- ANOVA test was performed for numerical variables. At the end of this, it was observed that the P-Value value was not larger than 0.5.

## D.Feature Enginering

- Label Encoding was performed. But it was found that there was no column that should be made Label Encoding.
- One-Hot Encoding was performed. At the end of this, It was observed that this process should be done in two features (['NACCNE4S', 'NACCAPOE']).

## E. Modeling

- The data imbalance in the train datas was removed with Smote OversamPling before the model was performed.
